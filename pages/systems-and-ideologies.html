    <h2>
      Systems
    </h2>

    <p>
    You may have heard of political terms like democracy, communism, dictatorships,
    left wing and right wing.
    </p>

    <p>
    These are terms used to describe the primary ways in which decisions are made
    and resources are shared, but also how the primary decision makers come to be
    in that community.
    </p>

    <p>
    A lot of these terms can have similar meanings. They can overlap with each
    other and they are also many variants within each one. This means that there
    can be infinite combination of political systems and positions you can take.
    </p>

    <p>
    This can make it very confusing to understand, so let's visualise these
    different political systems throught two scales or spectrums, and try to
    understand the basic principles underlying them.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The economic spectrum which shows the degree to which there is public 
        or private property</li>
      <li>The power spectrum which shows the degree to which decisions are made 
        by individuals or by a central authourity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    It's important to know that the systems on both spectrum each have their own
    pros and cons, and a community can theoretically prosper with any system. Over
    thousands of years however humans have to come to find that certain positions
    on the spectrum, or certain political systems are <em>more likely</em> to
    lead to a propering and fair society.
    </p>

    <h3>The power / social spectrum</h3>

    <p>
    Before looking at examples of some of the political systems at various points 
    on the spectrum, let's look at examples of decisions that we can make (or the 
    government may make for us).
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>What speed limit to drive at</li>
    <li>Who to marry</li>
    <li>What potential weapons to own</li>
    <li>Where to get an education</li>
    <li>What religious beliefs to have</li>
    <li>Where to live</li>
    <li>What book to read or movie to watch</li>
    <li>Whether to use mind-altering substances</li>
    <li>What to say and to who</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="../assets/power-system-scale.png" style="width: 100%;">

    <p>
    In an <strong>anarchy</strong>, any cooperation between individuals is done 
    on a voluntary
    basis. There is no central authority telling individuals what to do. This
    system can be seen to exist in nature, and humans too lived in this format
    during prehistoric times for thousands of years as tribal hunter-gatherers.
    Though it is very possible for an anarchy to be harmonious, particularly in 
    small groups, it is highly dependent on the voluntary co-operation of 
    individuals. It is likely for
    hierarchies to emerge as those who are lucky enough to be physically 
    stronger
    or have access to more natural resources around them, exert their influence
    onto others. Proponents of complete anarchy believe that humans are 
    naturally
    cooperative and don't need a central authority to tell them what to do, 
    while
    others would argue that history has demonstrated otherwise and that some 
    people
    will gladly oppress others for their own benefit without a centralised 
    authority to take some control.</p>

    <p>
    The terms <strong>autocracies</strong> and oligarchies are often used 
    interchangeably and they
    are very similar to each other. Technically an autocracy is rule by one
    individual, while an oligarchy is rule by a few inviduals. These systems can be
    further divided based on how these individuals or small groups came to power:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Monarchy</strong> - The classic <em>kings and queens</em>, 
        where power is passed onto family members. With the development of 
        agriculture, small hunter-gatherer communities started settling down in 
        one place and populations grew. The family became the smallest group 
        unit and the leaders would attempt to maintain power within their 
        families. Some of the oldest recorded monarchies were the Pharaohs of 
        Ancient Egypt around 3000 BCE, and even up until 200 years ago, most 
        countries were monarchies or some other form of autocracy.  The United 
        Kingdom is what is known as a constitutional monarchy, where the 
        leaders are elected and the royal family has little real power. The 
      largest real monarchy today is Saudi Arabia, ruled by Crown Prince 
      Mohammed bin Salman.</li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <strong>Plutocracy</strong> - A society that is ruled by the 
        <em>wealthiest individuals</em>. Some would argue that some modern 
        wealthy democracies are part plutocracies, as it is only the very 
        wealthy who have the means and opportunities to go into politics as a 
        career, and they in turn create policies that serve the wealth.  As an 
        example, in the U.K as of 2019, 29% of Members of Parliament went to 
        private school, compared to 7% of the general population.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        <strong>Aristocracy</strong> - From Greek, this literally means 'rule 
        by the best'. Though today it is a vague term with both positive and 
        negative connotations. It's come to be used as a general term for the 
        wealthiest, most powerful people in society. In Ancient Greece it was 
        contrasted favourably with monarchy, and they believed, that if it was 
        corrupted, where there is rule by the few but not by the best, it would 
        be easier to correct than a corrupt democracy which could descend into 
        mob rule.
      </li>
      <br>
    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
      A dictatorship can be thought of as an autocracy or oligarchy, but with 
      the emphasis that the have <em>complete control</em> over how the country 
      is run. A dictatorship can manifest through the above systems, but it can 
      also arise from the following:
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>Military dictatorship / Stratocracy</strong> - Rule by a 
      <em>military institution</em>, such as Myanmar, where following the coup 
      in February 2021, the military deposed the current democratically elected 
      members of the country and took control.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>Single party dictatorship</strong> - Rule by a single party 
      holding a unified ideology, such as China ruled by the Chinese Communist 
      Party (CCP), led by Xi Jinpig
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
      <strong>Personalist dictatorship</strong> - Rule by a single individual.  
      Though North Korea is technically a single party state, ruled by the 
      Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), it's leader Kim Jong-un holds such immense 
      power that many would classify it as a peronalist dictatorship. Since 
      leadership also passes down the Kim family, North Korea could also be 
      described as an absolute monarchy or a 'hereditary dictatorship'. Saudi 
      Arabia mentioned above could also be considered a 'herditary 
      dictatorship'.
    </li>

    </ul>


    <p>
    <strong>Democracy</strong>, from Greek, means 'rule by the people', and is 
    widely considered to
    the fairest political system. The first recorded democracy was the city-state
    of Athens around 500 BCE, where citizens where randomly selected to fill
    government positions, and all citizens could speak and vote to make decisions
    in public gatherings. Though the term citizen then was closely tied to those
    who were obligated to fight in war, and therefore excluded women, slaves and
    foreigners. This form of democracy where everyone participates in all
    decisions is called a <em>direct democracy</em> and is only really possible 
    in
    small communities. The prominent political system today is the 
    <em>representative
    democracy</em>, where 
    people vote to choose the people who they feel most accurately
    represent their own views, to make decisions in government. These people are
    often associated with a <em>party</em>, which is just a group of people who 
    hold
    similar views. Not everyone in a democracy had their voice heard straightaway.  
    Initially the government of the United Kingdom was only elected by male
    property owners, which was just 3% of the population in 1780. 
    <em>Suffrage</em> means the right to vote in political elections, and the 
    degree of universal
    suffrage (the right to vote without resriction due to gender, race, social
    status, education or wealth) is strongly correlated with the degree of
    democracy in a country. The journey to universal suffrage in every democracy
    has been a fiercel contested struggle with numerous revolutions, protests and
    violence. In 1893, New Zealand was the only country in the world with universal
    suffrage, while now 75 countries are considered to be democracies, with most
    having universal suffrage. Though a country may technically be a democracy, 
    i.e., it has elections to assign leaders, it's level of democracy, that is
    it's level of 'rule by the people' can differ greatly. For example, fewer
    significant parties, suppression of opposing parties, low levels of
    participation and corruption of government officials all decrease the level of
    democracy of country. The Economist Intelligence Group's <a 
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index" style="color: 
      var(--mineshaft)" target="_blank">Democracy Index</a> is a way to 
    objectively measure the level of democracy.

    <p>
    <em>
      Note: The names of parties and even of countries do
      not necessarily reflect on their political stance. For example, North Korea's
      offician name is the 'Democratic People's Republic of Korea', while it ranks
      last in the Democracy Index.

    <h3>
      The economic spectrum
    </h3>

    <p>
    The economic system of a country can be much more fluid than it's systems of
    power, so rather than look at individual countries or individual systems, let's
    look at the ideologies on either end of the scale and some examples of policies
    utilising these ideologies.
    </p>

    <img src="../assets/economic-system-scale.png" alt="Economic Spectrum" 
                                                   style="width: 100%;">

    <p>
    <strong>Socialism</strong> is the ideology that there should be social 
    ownership of property. As
    we saw in the first section, there can be many different kinds of 'property'.  
    In democracies, one way in which socialism takes places is in the form of
    <em>income redistribution</em> to fund public services. Wealthier 
    individuals pay a
    greater proportion of their income than people who aren't as well as off, in
    the form of taxes. These taxes then go on to fund public services that everyone
    has access to, such as transport, healthcare and education. One reasoning
    behind this is not everyone is born with the same privileges and opportunities,
    and therefore redistribution is required so no-one deprived of what is
    considered to be their basic rights and freedoms. Meanwhile 
    <strong>Capitalism</strong> argues
    that this redistribution of income violates the most important right of 
    all, that of <em>personal freedom</em> or liberty, and that society is 
    primarily meritocratic, which means that privilege and power is gained by 
    those on the basis of talent and effort.
    </p>

    <p>
    An important type of property that is at the centre of the socialism versus
    capitalism debate, is the <em>means of production</em>. This includes raw 
    materials,
    factories and infrastructure, through which products can be made and services 
    can be
    provided. Proponents of capitalism argue that private ownership of the means of
    productions, creates <em>innovation and economic growth</em>, as different 
    groups of
    people compete to create better products or provide better services utilising
    the means of production. This resulting improvement in the economy then
    benefits the whole population. A socialist criticism to this would be that this
    system prioritises profit over social good, and that demand for a product is
    not reflective of it's social value. They would say, for example that it's 
    unfair that celebrities and athletes receive disproportionately high 
    incomes, compared to say doctors or firefighters.
    </p>

    <p>
    Socialists might also argue that excessive private ownership creates a small
    capitalist class, who owns the means of production and who can then easily
    exploit the working class whose only real 'property ownership' is their own
    ability to labour. Capitalists would say that a class system is inevitable as
    different people desire different things and you shouldn't infringe on an
    individuals freedom to purchase, own or exchange property.
    </p>

    <p>
    <em>
      Note: Economic systems and power structures have existed for a long time, 
      but human rights as the freedoms that no policy can infringe has started 
      to develop and expand only relatively recently in human history. For 
      example, up until the early 1800s, slavery was common throughout the 
      world, i.e., the ownership of people themselves as property, who are then 
      employed in forced labour and forbidden to quit.
    </em>
    </p>

    <p>
    Socialist and capitalist policies can exist anywhere on the power spectrum,
    making it possible to create a four axis graph, which gives a general idea as
    to a policy's, person's, party's or country's political stance
    </p>

<img src="../assets/political-compass-simple.png" alt="Political Compass" 
                                                  style="width:100%;">

<p>
<em>
  Note: In a democracy, that there can be parties holding very different views,
  which is known as pluralism and is an important part of democracy. The above
  position in the graph of a democracy is primarily in comparison, or relative to 
  the other political systems on the graph.
</em>
</p>

<h2>
  Ideologies
</h2>

<p>
Political Ideologies can be

<ul>
  <li>general views on how society should be organised,</li>
  <li>patterns of behaviour that people or groups exhibit, or methods that are 
    used to achieve the above organisation</li>
  <li>specific stances on issues</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The systems we have just discussed can also be thought of as ideologies. Let's
look at some more common ones:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Communism</strong> - A highly authoritarian form of socialism. This 
means that for
example, rather than just redistribution of income, all property is either
owned communaly or owned by the state, most wages are set by the state and
strictly controlled. It is also often accompanied by reduced freedom of
expression and suppression of views contradictory to the ruling group.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Feminism</strong> - Focusing on creating equality between genders; for 
example in
suffrage, pay and education. Also improving reproductive rights and increasing
legal protection from domestic violence and sexual harassment.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Nationalism</strong> - Promoting the interests and independence of the 
home nation
</p>

<p>
<strong>Fascism</strong> - Dictatorships with an an extreme form of 
nationalism, characterized
by strict social heirarchies and use of force to suppress opposition. It's used
interchangeably with Nazism.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Imperialism</strong> - The policy of extending a country's power beyond 
it's own border,
which can be done through colonization, using military force or creating debt
</p>

<p>
<strong>Environmentalism</strong> - Focus on more policies being required to 
preserve, restore
and improve the environment.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Conservatism</strong> - While the actual principles may vary depending 
on the country,
the general belief is that tradition values and culture must be respected and
social change must be slow and incremental
