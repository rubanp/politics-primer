    <h1 style="text-align: center">What Is Politics?</h1>

    <p>
    The idea of politics often brings to mind prominent political figures such 
    as the prime minister and leaders of parties, buildings such as the houses 
    of parliament, and following laws lest you be jailed.
    </p>

    <p>
    While all these things are part of politics in the United Kingdom, it makes it
    seem as though politics is quite distant from our daily lives and not something
    to pay too much attention to.
    </p>

    <p>
    However the core of politics is very simple, and applies to a much broader
    ranger of things
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Politics is about making <span class="bold-italic">decisions</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      Politics is about making <span class="bold-italic">decisions</span> that 
      are <span class="bold-italic">fair and just</span>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      Politics is about people making group decisions as to how resources are shared 
      and what people should do, based on what they think is fair and just.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Lets break this statement down
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Groups - The 'group' in politics often means country, also referred to as a
        state, but it can also mean a city, a company, a sports club, a school and
        many more things. There always exists the difficult question of who belongs
        to a group, as some groups may be more preferable to be in that others. In a
        school this is simply anyone who studies or works at the school at the
        moment in time, while in a country it is more complex. You can be a member,
        or a citizen of a country, by being born there, but most countries also have
        processes where you can become a citizen of their country, and these
        processes are often quite complex.
      </li>
      <li>
        Making Decisions - How decisions are made and who gets to make them is the 
        foundation of politics.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sharing Resources - The primary resource here is often money. Countries 
        have a national budget, money they have collected through taxes that 
        they decide how to spend on public services. A sports club may have to 
        decide between hiring better coaches or buying new equipment, using the 
        fees they charge their members for using their facilities. Resources, 
        particularly in the case of countries can be many other things, like 
        land and the natural resources they contain, access to services like 
        public transport and healthcare and even the people themselves.
