    <h1 style="text-align: center">What Is Politics?</h1>

    <p>
    The idea of politics often brings to mind prominent political figures such as
    the prime minister, political parties such as the Conservatives and
    Labour, buildings such as the Houses Of Parliament, voting in
    elections and following laws.
    </p>

    <p>
    While all these things are part of politics in the United Kingdom, just by
    themselves it makes it politics seem distant and dull.
    </p>

---

<p>
The core definition of politics is very simple:
</p>

<p>
Politics is about making <span class="focus">decisions</span></p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Politics is about making <span class="focus">decisions</span> that are <span 
  class="focus">fair and just</span> as to how <span class="focus">resources 
  are shared</span> and <span class="focus">what people should do</span>.
</p>

---

<p>
As you can see the above definition of politics can apply to any group of
people. People form groups to work towards common goals. This group can mean a
country and any of it's components such as cities or counties, and also groups
of countries such as the European Union (EU); it can also mean a company, a
sports club, a school and many other organised groups.
</p>

<p>
The means that politics overlaps with other fields; economics, law, business,
psychology and philosophy.
</p>

<p>
To understand the definition above, let's break down and explore what each
highlight part one means, using relatable examples to better appreciate the
underlying principles.
</p>

<p>
<em>Note: The words 'state', 'country' and 'nation' are often used 
  interchangeably in political writing. This can be confusing as some large 
  countries also have 'states' as one of their components, for example USA and 
Australia. We'll be using the term state, as it's used more often to mean a 
single political unit, while a country technically refers to the geographical 
area.</em>
</p>

<h2> Making Decisions </h2>

<p>
How decisions are made, who gets to make them and enforce them is perhaps the
most important decision of all.
</p>

<p>
There exists a fine balance these elements and the way this balance exists has
been a source of conflict in every group for all of human history.
</p>

<p>
In very small groups, it's possible for everyone to be involved in every
decision that affects the group, but as groups get larger there emerges a
natural divide where some people make decisions on behalf of the group. These
people are said to 'in power' or the 'ruling class'
</p>

<p>
When there is majority level of agreement as to this process there is
harmony, while disagreement can lead to conflict and historically violence.
</p>

<p>
The decision making process forms the basis of how countries are organised and
run, which we call their political systems, and we'll be exploring these in the
next section.
</p>

<p>
These decisions are implemented primarily in the form of laws, also called
legislature.
</p>

<p>
A politician therefore is someone who is directly involved decision making
process as part of the governing group, the government.
</p>

<p>
There are many ways you can take part in the politics in the United Kingdom
aside from becoming a politician and we will look at this in the `take action`
section.
</p>

<h2> Group Membership </h2>

<p>
There always exists the question of who belongs to the group, as some groups
may be more preferable for some people be in than others, due to the resources
they have and what the people can do there.
</p>

<p>
In a school a member can be thought of as anyone who studies at the school.
Some schools are open to anyone under the age of 16, while others may require
you to pass an entrance exam or pay fees.
</p>

<p>
You can be a member, or a citizen of a country, by being born there, but most
countries also have processes where others can become a citizen of their country,
and these processes come under immigration and naturalisation law.
</p>

<p>
You can also visit countries without having to become a citizen. Some countries
have more open borders than others and most have different rules for entry
depending on the person's country of origin. Some countries such as North
Korea, not only are very difficult to enter but are also very difficult for
their citizens to leave the country at all.
</p>

<h2> What Is Fair and Just </h2>

<p>
This aspect of politics is called ethics and is part of every decision that is
made. When asking what is fair and just, we are essentially asking what actions
are good and what actions are evil and then using these principles in making
decisions. Since this is a very broad field, let's look one area in which ideas
of fairness and justice are on the forefront, criminal law.
</p>

<p>
Even things that on the surface may seem to be straightforward, such as the
morality of killing, can be highly dependent on the situation in which it
occurs. Let's look at a thought process on deciding whether killing someone is
wrong:
</p>

<p>
"Killing someone is wrong, and if someone does they must be punished and
separated from the rest of society to protect others"
</p>

<p>
"But what if their life was in danger from someone else and they killed them
was done in self defense. That must be okay"
</p>

<p>
"But what if they used unneccessary force, that is they shot someone when all
that happened was an unarmed person pushed them slightly. That doesn't seem
right"
</p>

<p>
"What if another person else walks past someone on the street who needed
medical help and did nothing, resulting in their death. Is that wrong even
thought they weren't directly involved"
</p>

<p>
Things get more complicated when determining the degree of 'punishment'
the wrong doer must receive to deter others from doing the same thing, or the 
level of 'compensation' the victim gets.
</p>

<h2> Sharing Resources </h2>

<p>
The primary resource here is often money, but this is simply because we use
money as a store and exchange of value for many different things. The money
itself can represent many other resources. A gym may have to decide
between hiring more personal trainers or buying new equipment, using the fees
they charge their members for using their facilities. They may then have to
decide which classes the personal trainers should teach, allocating the
resource of 'labour' or people; and then deciding where best to position
</p>

<p>
Countries have a national budget, money that has been collected through taxes
that they then decide how to spend. It may be spent on public services like
healthcare and public transport, while in countries whose political systems
aren't as fair and could be seen as corrupt, a large proportion may go directly
to the leaders personal accounts.
</p>

<p>
Another important resources in countries is land and the natural resources they
contain. Historically many wars have been fought over this resource. Countries
may also decide to trade their own resources with other countries, known as
imports and exports.
</p>

<p>
For example, 60% of food in Japan is imported, as it has little land area that
is suitable for farming, while it is the world's 2nd largest exporter of cars
</p>

<h2> What People Should Do </h2>

<p>
These can be broadly divided into 'rights and freedoms' and 'duties and
responsibilities'
</p>

<p>
Rights and freedoms are those things that apply to every human and cannot be
taken away. They are based on shared values like dignity, fairness, equality,
respect and independence. No one can violate or take away someone else's basic
rights and freedoms.
</p>

<p>
While different countries may ensure different fundamental rights for their
citizens, they often include things like 'the freedom from slavery', 'the right
to a fair trial' and 'the right to education'. The UK follows the European
Convention on Human Rights, which also includes 'the abolition of the death
penalty', which for example is not present in the USA; and freedom of
expression (freedom of speech and the media), which for example many would
argue is not present in China.
</p>

<p>
The duties and responsibilities aspect can be thought of as applying and
extending these rights and freedoms, in different areas and processes. For
example contract law outlines how agreements must be made between different
parties in different situations, like hiring employees. The lack these laws
employees being made to do unsafe tasks or work extremely long hours. Meanwhile
property law ensures that your belongings which could range from land and
houses to personal items like computers and phones cannot be unfairly taken
from you.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to take the existence of these for granted, if we've grown up having
been accustomed to their presence, but it's important to remember that they
weren't always around and for many people in the world still are not there.
Also it's always possible to improve them based on what you believe is fair and
just.
