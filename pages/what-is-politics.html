    <h1 style="text-align: center">What Is Politics?</h1>

    <p>
    The idea of politics in the United Kingdom often brings to mind prominent 
    political figures such as the <em>Prime Minister</em>, political parties 
        such as the <em>Conservatives</em> and <em>Labour</em>, the <em>Palace 
          of Westminster</em> (pictured below), voting in elections and 
        following laws.  while all these things are a part of politics, just by 
        themselves it can make it seem distant and dull.  </p>
    <hr class="divider">
    <p>
    The core definition of politics is very simple: </p>
    <p>
    Politics is about making <span class="focus">decisions</span> </p>
    <p>
    Politics is about making <span class="focus">decisions</span> that are 
    <span class="focus">fair and just</span>.</p>
    <p>
    Politics is about <span class="focus">people in groups</span> making <span 
      class="focus">decisions</span> that are <span class="focus">fair and 
      just</span> as to how <span class="focus">resources are shared</span> and 
      <span class="focus">what people should do</span>.  </p>
    <hr class="divider">
    <p>
    As you can see, the above definitions of politics can apply to any person 
    or group of people. This group can mean a country and any of it's 
    components such as cities or counties, and also groups of countries such as 
    the European Union (EU); it can also mean a company, a sports club, a 
    school and many other organised groups.</p>
    <p>From the beginning of human history, people have formed groups, to work 
    together towards common goals. In very small groups, everyone can be 
    involved in all the decisions the group makes, but as groups get larger, 
    naturally some people will start making decisions on behalf of the whole 
    group, and this is really where politics begins.</p>
    <p>To understand the definition above, let's break down and explore what 
    each highlight part one means, using relatable examples to better 
    appreciate the underlying principles.</p>

    <p><em>Note: The words 'state', 'country' and 'nation' are often used 
      interchangeably in political writing. This can be confusing as some large 
      countries also have 'states' as one of their components, for example USA 
      and Australia. Though these terms are subtly different, for the purposes 
      of this course, we'll treat them the same</em> </p>

    <h2 id="making-decisions"> Making Decisions </h2>
    <p>
    <span class="focus">How decisions are made</span>, <span class="focus">who 
      gets to make them</span> and <span class="focus">who gets to enforce 
      them</span> is perhaps the most important decision of all.</p>
    <p>There exists a fine balance between these elements and the way this 
    balance exists has been a source of conflict in every group for all of 
    human history.</p>
    <p>When there is majority level of agreement as to this process, there is 
    harmony, while disagreement can lead to conflict and historically 
    violence.</p>
    <p>
    The decision making process forms the basis of how countries are organised 
    and and we'll be exploring these systems in the next section.</p>
    <p>
    These decisions are implemented primarily in the form of laws, also called
    legislature.</p>
    <p>
    A politician therefore is someone who is directly involved in the decision 
    making
    process as part of the main decision making group, also known as the 
    government.</p>

    <h2> Group Membership </h2>
    <p>There always exists the question of <span class="focus">who belongs to 
      the group</span>, as some groups may be more preferable for some people 
    to be in than others, due to the resources
    they have and what the people can do there.</p>
    <p>For example, in a school a member can be thought of as anyone who 
    studies at the school. Some schools are open to anyone under the age of 16, 
    while others may require you to pass an entrance exam or pay fees.</p>
    <p>You can be a member, also known as a citizen, of a country by being born 
    there, but most
    countries also have processes where others can also become a citizen,
    and these processes come under immigration and naturalisation law.</p>
    <p>You can also visit countries without having to become a citizen. Some 
    countries
    have more open borders than others and most have different rules for entry
    depending on the person's country of origin, which is identified by a 
    passport when you travel, and the reasons for their travel. The document 
    that allows someone to legally enter a foreign country is called a visa.  
    However depending on your passport you can visit some countries without 
    requiring a visa, or you can obtain a visa once you're already there, 
    rather than having to apply and obtain it beforehand.  The ability to do 
    this is known as the passport's Mobility Score</p>

    <h2> What Is Fair and Just </h2>
    <p> This aspect of politics is called ethics and is a part of every 
    decision that is made. When asking what is fair and just, we are 
    essentially asking <span class="focus">what actions are good</span> and 
    <span class="focus">what actions are evil</span> and then using these 
    principles in making decisions.  Since this is a very broad field, let's 
    look one area in which ideas of fairness and justice are on the forefront, 
    criminal law.</p>
    <p>
    Even things that on the surface may seem to be straightforward, such as the
    morality of killing, can be highly dependent on the situation in which it
    occurs. Let's look at a thought process on deciding whether killing someone 
                 is
    wrong:</p>
    <p>
    "Killing someone is wrong, and if someone does they must be punished and
    separated from the rest of society to protect others"</p>
    <p>
    "But what if their life was in danger from someone else and it was done in 
    self defense. That must be okay"</p>
    <p>
    "But what if they used unneccessary force, that is they shot someone when 
    all that happened was an unarmed person pushed them slightly. That doesn't 
    seem right"</p>
    <p>
    "What if another person walks past someone else on the street who needed
    medical help and did nothing, resulting in their death. Is that wrong even
    thought they weren't directly involved?"</p>
    <p>
    Things get more complicated when determining the degree of 
    <em>punishment</em>the wrong doer must receive to deter others from doing 
    the same thing, or the level of <em>compensation</em> the victim gets.</p>

    <h2> Sharing Resources </h2>
    <p>
    The primary resource here is often money, but this is simply because we use 
    money as a store and exchange of value for many different things. The money 
    itself can represent any other resource. A gym may have to decide between 
    hiring more personal trainers or buying new equipment, using the fees they 
    charge their members for using their facilities. They may then have to 
    decide which classes the personal trainers should teach, allocating the 
    resource of <em>labour</em> or people.</p>
    <p>
    Countries have a <span class="focus">national budget</span>, money that has 
    been collected through taxes that they then decide how to spend. It may be 
    spent on public services like healthcare and public transport, while in 
    countries whose political systems aren't as fair and could be seen as 
    corrupt, a large proportion may go directly to the leader's personal 
    accounts.  Another important resources in countries is land and the natural 
    resources they contain.  Historically many wars have been fought over this 
    resource.</p>
    <img src="../assets/uk-2017-government-budget.png" style="width: 100%;">
    <p>
    Countries may also decide to trade their own resources with other 
    countries, known as imports and exports. For example, 60% of food consumed 
    in Japan is imported in, because it has little land area that is suitable 
    for farming, while it is the world's 2nd largest exporter of cars</p>

    <h2> What People Should Do </h2>
    <p>
    These can be broadly divided into <span class="focus">rights and 
      freedoms</span> and <span class="focus">duties and 
      responsibilities</span></p>
    <p>
    Rights and freedoms are those things that apply to every human and cannot 
    be
    taken away. They are based on shared values like dignity, fairness, 
    equality,
    respect and independence. No one can violate or take away someone else's 
    basic
    rights and freedoms.</p>
    <p>
    While different countries may ensure different fundamental rights for their
    citizens, they often include things like <em>the freedom from slavery</em>, 
    <em>the right to a fair trial</em> and <em>the right to education</em>.  
    The UK follows the European Convention on Human Rights, which also includes 
    <em>the abolition of the death penalty</em>, which for example is not 
    present in all states in the USA; and <em>freedom of expression</em> 
    (freedom of speech and the media), which for example many would argue is 
    not present in China.</p>
    <p>
    The duties and responsibilities aspect can be thought of as applying and
    extending these rights and freedoms, in different areas and processes. For
    example contract law outlines how agreements must be made between different
    parties in different situations, like hiring employees. The lack of these 
    laws may mean employees being made to do unsafe tasks or work extremely 
    long hours. Meanwhile property law ensures that your belongings, which 
    could range from land and houses to personal items like computers and 
    phones, cannot be unfairly taken from you.</p>
    <p>
    It is easy to take the existence of these for granted if we've grown up 
    having been accustomed to their presence, but it's important to remember 
    that they weren't always around and for many people in the world are still 
    not there.</p>
