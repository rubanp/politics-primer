   <h1>About Politics Primer</h1>
   <p>
   Politics Primer was created as a resource for people in the United Kingdom, 
   primarily those have not studied Government and Politics at school, to gain 
   an understanding of and interest in politics. Concepts are explained using a 
   bottom up approach, focusing on the underlying principles and philosophy.  
   The aim was to create a resource that can be understood by a wide age range, 
   and can provide a basis for further exploration and research into politics.  
   I believe it is as free from bias and neutral as is possible in a political 
   guide.
