   <h1>About Politics Primer</h1>
   <p>Politics Primer was created as a resource for people in the United 
   Kingdom, primarily those have not studied Government and Politics at school, 
   to gain an understanding of and interest in politics. The hope is that this 
   will lead to a better understanding of their political views and more 
   engagement in the political process. Concepts are explained using a 
   bottom-up approach, focusing on the underlying principles and philosophy, 
   something I felt was rare in most political information. The aim was to 
   create a resource that can be understood by a wide age range and can provide 
   a basis for further exploration and research into politics. I believe it is 
   as free from bias and neutral as is possible in a political guide. The code 
   and content are available at <a
