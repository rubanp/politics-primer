    <h1 style="text-align: center">Government</h1>

    <p>
    In this section we'll be looking at how the leadership (the government) is
    setup and organised in a fair democracy. The government is not a single unit,
    but rather consists of three parts, with no person technically being allowed to
    belong to more than one part, though there is often minor overlap.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Legislative</strong> - the part that makes laws</li>
      <li><strong>Executive</strong> - the part that carries out (executes) the 
        laws</li>
      <li><strong>Judiciary</strong> - the courts that decide if the law has 
        been broken</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    This concept is called <em>separation of powers</em>. This exists to ensure 
    that
    for example, people cannot create laws (as part of the legislative) that
    they can execute (as part of the executive) to help themselves financially 
    or give themselves more power, or ignore laws they've broken (as part of 
    the judiciary). The three parts keep each other in check, which is known as 
    having <em>checks and balances</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Another concept is <em>devolution</em>, which is transfer of power from the
    central government to local government. When this transfer of power is
    permanent, protected and extensive, it is known as <em>federalism</em> and
    countries operating like this are know as federal states, such as the United
    States of America and Australia, where policies between states can be
    significantly different. The United Kingdom on the other hand is a 
    <em>unitary state</em>, meaning the majority of power rests with the 
    central government.
    </p>

    <p>
    The executive and legislative is what most people consider to be the 
    government, as this is the area of government that politicians are involved 
    in, as opposed to judges in the judiciary.
    </p>

<h2> Legislative </h2>

<p>
The legislative branch of the government can be <em>unicameral</em>, containing 
one
house, or <em>bicameral</em>, containing two houses. Most governments have a
bicameral system to avoid having power concentrated in one group.<br>The United
Kingdom legislative branch is called the <strong>Parliament of the United 
  Kingdom</strong> and
consists of the <strong>House of Commons</strong> and the <strong>House of 
  Lords</strong>.<br>The United States
legislative branch is called the <strong>Congress</strong> and consists of the 
<strong>House of Representatives</strong>and the <strong>Senate</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The bicameral systems typically have a:<br><strong>Lower house</strong> (House 
of Commons, House
of Representatives) which consists of members directly elected by
the general population, and an<br><strong>Upper house</strong> (House of Lords, 
Senate)
consisting of members who are separately appointed in some manner.
</p>

<p>
Members who are elected to the lower house are often part of groups called 
parties, which as mentioned befored are groups of people who hold similar 
political ideologies.  The leaders of the party are the face of the election 
campaigns.  Though their individual personalities and characteristics can have 
a significant influence on the outcome of the election, citizens are in reality 
voting for the party. Party members don't stand for election nationally, but 
rather for a specific region, and if their party gets the most votes in that 
region, they are said to then go on to represent that region in parliament. The 
head of the government is the leader of the party that then has the most 
representatives in government. This party is said to have the majority, while 
the party getting the second highest number of votes is said to have the 
minority, or be the opposition.
</p>

<p>
You may come across the terms <em>head of state</em> and <em>head of 
  government</em>. These terms exists because historically the head of the 
state was the king and as countries evolved to incorporate democracy and have 
elected governments, there was also the head of the government. In countries 
that evolved this way, the head of state role is now largely ceremonial. For 
example, in the United Kingdom the head of government is the Prime Minister, 
while the head of state is Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

<h2> Executive </h2>

<p>
You would have likely heard the terms Prime Minister and President, and that
some countries have one and not the other. This happens because it's based on
one of two primary ways that the executive branch is set up, the parliamentary
system and presidential system. Depending on how system a country uses, it 
changes, which title is effectively the head of government and has the most 
power.  The executive also consists of the heads of the different government 
departments.  </p>

<p>
In a <strong>parliamentary system</strong>, the executive branch often derives 
from the legislative, with the head of the executive branch also being the head 
of the legislative branch. This though infringing on the concept of separation 
of powers, still works because checks and balances are maintained through other 
processes, like having a separate head of state or other laws that are in place 
to limit power.  </p>

<p>
United Kingdom follows a parliamentary system; the head is the Prime Minister,
who is the leader of the party that won a majority of votes in the general
election. The executive is called the Cabinet and the rest of the members are
selected by the Prime Minister, and they are called Cabinet Ministers.
</p>

<p>
In a <strong>presidential system</strong>, there is stricter separation between 
the executive and the legislature. The President is the head of the executive, 
while the Prime Minister (if one exists) is the head of the legislature.
</p>

<p>
The United States follows a presidential system; the head is the President, who
is the leader of the party who received the majority of votes in the general
election. The executive is also called the Cabinet and chosen by the President.  
The leaders of Congress meanwhile are elected by their
respective houses (House of Representatives and Senate). Each house, from their
respective parties elect a Majority Leader, Majority Whip, Minority Leader and
Minority Whip. The main leader of the Congress is the Speaker of the House, who 
is elected by the House of Representatives, by both the majority and minority 
party.
</p>

<h1> Voting </h1>

<p>
Voting is the way through which everyone in a democracy can participate in the
political process. It's important to vote even if you feel the party you would
like to win stands little change of winning in your region. This is because it
shows support for the policies that party is advocating for, and makes it more
likely that the winning party will pay attention to them. Even if you don't
want to vote, because for example you highly disagree with all parties or feel
disillusioned with the political process and you feel you aren't truly being
heard, you can make this known to the government by 'spoiling the ballot'. You
do this by submitting a ballot that is ineligible, like the example below.
These are recorded and counted. They won't be a vote towards any party, and
instead reflect on the number of dissatisfied voters.

Before voting it's important to first understand what your views are and what
changes you would like to be made in society. Hopefully this resource you have
just gone through has contributed to that. Some more resources include:

  <li style="list-style-type: none;">
    <a href="https://www.politicalcompass.org/" style="color: 
                                               var(--mineshaft);">Political Compass</a> - A quiz to give a general idea of 
                                             your political stance.  Though it's result can be controversial depending on 
                                             who is asked, the
                                             questions it uses are thought provoking and worthy of discussion. The site also
                                             features a section where they analyise the viewpoints of different parties in
                                             elections, in the major democracies around the world, including the United 
                                             Kingomd.

</ul>
</p>

<p>
Don't forget that you should remain open to your views changing, and open to
difficult conversation on controversial political issues. Debate is the primary
means by which politicians come to a consensus on a decision, and this should
be reflected by the citizens
</p>

<p>
Secondly you need to find the party that most fits your views and the changes
you want to see made. This is best done by reading each party's manifesto, 
which they publish before each election. This overview of the parties ideology 
and policies is important, as parties often attempt to polarise the population 
by focusing on one specific policy, which although might be important to you, 
will only be one aspect of what the pary is attempting to do.</p>

<p>
Often in the weeks to months before a general election, there will be increased
discussion both in person and on social media and you may come across
propoganda, which is political information, often of a misleading nature,
designed to promote a particular point of view. It can be useful to check these
claims on fact checking websites such as <a href="https://fullfact.org/latest/" 
  style="color: var(--mineshaft)">Full Fact</a>
</p>

<p>
Other than voting, an easy way to get involved is via <a 
  href="https://petition.parliament.uk/" style="color: 
        var(--mineshaft)">petitions</a>.  In the UK, if a petition gets 10,000 
      signatures, it must be responded to by the government.  If a petition 
      gets 100,000 signatures, it will be considered for debate, which it 
      nearly always is.
</p>

<p>
You can also join pressure groups to raise awareness on specific issues. A list 
of United Kingdom pressure groups can be found <a
