# What Is Politics?

The idea of politics often brings to mind prominent political figures such as
the **_prime minister_**, political parties such as the **_Conservatives_** and
**_Labour_**, buildings such as the **_Houses Of Parliament_**, voting in
elections and following laws.

While all these things are part of politics in the United Kingdom, just by
themselves it makes it politics seem distant and dull.

The core definition of politics is very simple:

Politics is about making **_decisions_**

Politics is about making **_decisions_** that are **_fair and just_**.

Politics is about making **_decisions_** that are **_fair and just_** as to how
**_resources are shared_** and **_what people should do_**

As you can see the above definition of politics can apply to any group of
people. People form groups to work towards common goals. This group can mean a
country and any of it's components such as cities or counties, and also groups
of countries such as the European Union (EU); it can also mean a company, a
sports club, a school and many other organised groups.

The means that politics overlaps with other fields; economics, law, business,
psychology and philosophy.

To understand the definition above, let's break down and explore what each
highlight part one means, using relatable examples to better appreciate the
underlying principles.

_Note: The words 'state', 'country' and 'nation' are often used interchangeably
in political writing. This can be confusing as some large countries also have
'states' as one of their components, for example USA and Australia. Throughout
this course, we'll be sticking to using 'country'_

## Making Decisions

How decisions are made, who gets to make them and enforce them is perhaps the
most important decision of all.

There exists a fine balance these elements and the way this balance exists has
been a source of conflict in every group for all of human history.

In very small groups, it's possible for everyone to be involved in every
decision that affects the group, but as groups get larger there emerges a
natural divide where some people make decisions on behalf of the group. These
people are said to 'in power' or the 'ruling class'

When there is majority level of agreement as to this process there is
harmony, while disagreement can lead to conflict and historically violence.

The decision making process forms the basis of how countries are organised and
run, which we call their political systems, and we'll be exploring these in the
next section.

These decisions are implemented primarily in the form of laws, also called
legislature.

A politician therefore is someone who is directly involved decision making
process as part of the governing group, the government.

There are many ways you can take part in the politics in the United Kingdom
aside from becoming a politician and we will look at this in the `take action`
section.

## Group Membership

There always exists the question of who belongs to the group, as some groups
may be more preferable for some people be in than others, due to the resources
they have and what the people can do there.

In a school a member can be thought of as anyone who studies at the school.  
Some schools are open to anyone under the age of 16, while others may require
you to pass an entrance exam or pay fees.

You can be a member, or a citizen of a country, by being born there, but most
countries also have processes where others can become a citizen of their country,
and these processes come under immigration and naturalisation law.

You can also visit countries without having to become a citizen. Some countries
have more open borders than others and most have different rules for entry
depending on the person's country of origin. Some countries such as North
Korea, not only are very difficult to enter but are also very difficult for
their citizens to leave the country at all.

## What Is Fair and Just

This aspect of politics is called ethics and is part of every decision that is
made. When asking what is fair and just, we are essentially asking what actions
are good and what actions are evil and then using these principles in making
decisions. Since this is a very broad field, let's look one area in which ideas
of fairness and justice are on the forefront, criminal law.

Even things that on the surface may seem to be straightforward, such as the
morality of killing, can be highly dependent on the situation in which it
occurs. Let's look at a thought process on deciding whether killing someone is
wrong:

"Killing someone is wrong, and if someone does they must be punished and
separated from the rest of society to protect others"

"But what if their life was in danger from someone else and they killed them
was done in self defense. That must be okay"

"But what if they used unneccessary force, that is they shot someone when all
that happened was an unarmed person pushed them slightly. That doesn't seem
right"

"What if another person else walks past someone on the street who needed
medical help and did nothing, resulting in their death. Is that wrong even
thought they weren't directly involved"

Things get more complicated when determining the **_degree of 'punishment'_**
the wrong doer must receive to deter others from doing the same thing, or the
**_level of 'compensation'_** the victim gets.

## Sharing Resources

The primary resource here is often money, but this is simply because we use
money as a store and exchange of value for many different things. The money
itself can represent many other resources. A gym may have to decide
between hiring more personal trainers or buying new equipment, using the fees
they charge their members for using their facilities. They may then have to
decide which classes the personal trainers should teach, allocating the
resource of 'labour' or people; and then deciding where best to position

Countries have a national budget, money that has been collected through taxes
that they then decide how to spend. It may be spent on public services like
healthcare and public transport, while in countries whose political systems
aren't as fair, a large proportion may go directly to the leaders.

Another important resources in countries is land and the natural resources they
contain. Historically many wars have been fought over this resource. Countries
may also decide to trade their own resources with other countries, known as
imports and exports.

For example, 60% of food in Japan is imported, as it has little land area that
is suitable for farming, while it is the world's 2nd largest exporter of cars

## What People Should Do

These can be broadly divided into 'rights and freedoms' and 'duties and
responsibilities'

Rights and freedoms are those things that apply to every human and cannot be
taken away. They are based on shared values like dignity, fairness, equality,
respect and independence. No one can violate or take away someone else's basic
rights and freedoms.

The duties and responsibilities apply these

# Political Systems

You may have heard of political terms like democracy, communism and
dictatorships. These are terms used to describe systems on how decisions are
made and who gets to make them

Let's model some of these systems in your school so you can better understand
them.
