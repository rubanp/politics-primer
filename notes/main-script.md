# What Is Politics?

The idea of politics often brings to mind prominent political figures such as
the **_prime minister_**, political parties such as the **_Conservatives_** and
**_Labour_**, buildings such as the **_Houses Of Parliament_**, voting in
elections and following laws.

`Slider with images of the above`

While all these things are part of politics in the United Kingdom, just by
themselves it makes it politics seem distant and dull.

---

The core definition of politics is very simple:

Politics is about making **_decisions_**

Politics is about making **_decisions_** that are **_fair and just_**.

Politics is about making **_decisions_** that are **_fair and just_** as to how
**_resources are shared_** and **_what people should do_**

---

As you can see the above definition of politics can apply to any group of
people. People form groups to work towards common goals. This group can mean a
country and any of it's components such as cities or counties, and also groups
of countries such as the European Union (EU); it can also mean a company, a
sports club, a school and many other organised groups.

The means that politics overlaps with other fields; economics, law, business,
psychology and philosophy.

To understand the definition above, let's break down and explore what each
highlight part one means, using relatable examples to better appreciate the
underlying principles.

_Note: The words 'state', 'country' and 'nation' are often used interchangeably
in political writing. This can be confusing as some large countries also have
'states' as one of their components, for example USA and Australia. We'll be
using the term state, as it's used more often to mean a single political unit,
while a country technically refers to the geographical area._

## Making Decisions

How decisions are made, who gets to make them and enforce them is perhaps the
most important decision of all.

There exists a fine balance these elements and the way this balance exists has
been a source of conflict in every group for all of human history.

In very small groups, it's possible for everyone to be involved in every
decision that affects the group, but as groups get larger there emerges a
natural divide where some people make decisions on behalf of the group. These
people are said to 'in power' or the 'ruling class'

When there is majority level of agreement as to this process there is
harmony, while disagreement can lead to conflict and historically violence.

The decision making process forms the basis of how countries are organised and
run, which we call their political systems, and we'll be exploring these in the
next section.

These decisions are implemented primarily in the form of laws, also called
legislature.

A politician therefore is someone who is directly involved decision making
process as part of the governing group, the government.

There are many ways you can take part in the politics in the United Kingdom
aside from becoming a politician and we will look at this in the `take action`
section.

## Group Membership

There always exists the question of who belongs to the group, as some groups
may be more preferable for some people be in than others, due to the resources
they have and what the people can do there.

In a school a member can be thought of as anyone who studies at the school.
Some schools are open to anyone under the age of 16, while others may require
you to pass an entrance exam or pay fees.

You can be a member, or a citizen of a country, by being born there, but most
countries also have processes where others can become a citizen of their country,
and these processes come under immigration and naturalisation law.

You can also visit countries without having to become a citizen. Some countries
have more open borders than others and most have different rules for entry
depending on the person's country of origin. Some countries such as North
Korea, not only are very difficult to enter but are also very difficult for
their citizens to leave the country at all.

## What Is Fair and Just

This aspect of politics is called ethics and is part of every decision that is
made. When asking what is fair and just, we are essentially asking what actions
are good and what actions are evil and then using these principles in making
decisions. Since this is a very broad field, let's look one area in which ideas
of fairness and justice are on the forefront, criminal law.

Even things that on the surface may seem to be straightforward, such as the
morality of killing, can be highly dependent on the situation in which it
occurs. Let's look at a thought process on deciding whether killing someone is
wrong:

"Killing someone is wrong, and if someone does they must be punished and
separated from the rest of society to protect others"

"But what if their life was in danger from someone else and they killed them
was done in self defense. That must be okay"

"But what if they used unneccessary force, that is they shot someone when all
that happened was an unarmed person pushed them slightly. That doesn't seem
right"

"What if another person else walks past someone on the street who needed
medical help and did nothing, resulting in their death. Is that wrong even
thought they weren't directly involved"

Things get more complicated when determining the **_degree of 'punishment'_**
the wrong doer must receive to deter others from doing the same thing, or the
**_level of 'compensation'_** the victim gets.

## Sharing Resources

The primary resource here is often money, but this is simply because we use
money as a store and exchange of value for many different things. The money
itself can represent many other resources. A gym may have to decide
between hiring more personal trainers or buying new equipment, using the fees
they charge their members for using their facilities. They may then have to
decide which classes the personal trainers should teach, allocating the
resource of 'labour' or people; and then deciding where best to position

Countries have a national budget, money that has been collected through taxes
that they then decide how to spend. It may be spent on public services like
healthcare and public transport, while in countries whose political systems
aren't as fair and could be seen as corrupt, a large proportion may go directly
to the leaders personal accounts.

Another important resources in countries is land and the natural resources they
contain. Historically many wars have been fought over this resource. Countries
may also decide to trade their own resources with other countries, known as
imports and exports.

For example, 60% of food in Japan is imported, as it has little land area that
is suitable for farming, while it is the world's 2nd largest exporter of cars

## What People Should Do

These can be broadly divided into 'rights and freedoms' and 'duties and
responsibilities'

Rights and freedoms are those things that apply to every human and cannot be
taken away. They are based on shared values like dignity, fairness, equality,
respect and independence. No one can violate or take away someone else's basic
rights and freedoms.

While different countries may ensure different fundamental rights for their
citizens, they often include things like 'the freedom from slavery', 'the right
to a fair trial' and 'the right to education'. The UK follows the European
Convention on Human Rights, which also includes 'the abolition of the death
penalty', which for example is not present in the USA; and freedom of
expression (freedom of speech and the media), which for example many would
argue is not present in China.

The duties and responsibilities aspect can be thought of as applying and
extending these rights and freedoms, in different areas and processes. For
example contract law outlines how agreements must be made between different
parties in different situations, like hiring employees. The lack these laws
employees being made to do unsafe tasks or work extremely long hours. Meanwhile
property law ensures that your belongings which could range from land and
houses to personal items like computers and phones cannot be unfairly taken
from you.

It is easy to take the existence of these for granted, if we've grown up having
been accustomed to their presence, but it's important to remember that they
weren't always around and for many people in the world still are not there.
Also it's always possible to improve them based on what you believe is fair and
just.

# Systems and Ideologies

## Systems

You may have heard of political terms like democracy, communism, dictatorships,
left wing and right wing.

These are terms used to describe the primary ways in which decisions are made
and resources are shared, but also how the primary decision makers come to be
in that community.

A lot of these terms can have similar meanings. They can overlap with each
other and they are also many variants within each one. This means that there
can be infinite combination of political systems and positions you can take.
It's made even more difficult

This can make it very confusing to understand, so let's visualise these
different political systems throught two scales or spectrums, and try to
understand the basic principles underlying them.

- The economic spectrum which shows the degree to which there is public or
  private property
- The power spectrum which shows the degree to which decisions are made by
  individuals or by a central authourity

_ Note: Typically in media and discussion, these two spectrums are combined
and simplified further into just left or right wing, but this can be
misleading as people may have different stances on different issues, so it's
always best to do your own research on that particular issue to find out what  
politicians or the media mean when they generalise say they take a 'left
wing' or 'right wing' viewpoint_

It's important to know that the systems on both spectrum each have their own
pros and cons, and a community can theoretically prosper with any system. Over
thousands of years however humans have to come to find that certain positions
on the spectrum, or certain political systems are **_more likely_** to
lead to a propering and fair society.

### The power spectrum

Before looking at some of the political systems at various on the spectrum,
let's look at some examples of decisions that we can make (or the government
may make for us).

- What speed limit to drive at
- Who to marry
- What potential weapons to own
- Where to get an education
- What religious beliefs to have
- Where to live
- What book to read or movie to watch
- Whether to use mind-altering substances
- What to say and to who

In an anarchy, any cooperation between individuals is done on a voluntary
basis. There is no central authority telling individuals what to do. This
system can be seen to exist in nature, and humans too lived in this format
during prehistoric times for thousands of years as tribal hunter-gatherers.
Though it is very possible for an anarchy to be harmonious, it is highly
dependent on the voluntary co-operation of individuals. It is likely for
hierarchies to emerge as those who are lucky enough to be physically stronger
or have access to more natural resources around them, exert their influence
onto others. Proponents of anarchy believe that humans are naturally
cooperative and don't need a central authority to tell them what to do, while
others would argue that history has demonstrated otherwise and that some people
will gladly oppress others for their own benefit.

The terms autocracies and oligarchies are often used interchangeably and they
are very similar to each other. Technically an autocracy is rule by one
individual, while an oligarchy is rule by a few inviduals. These systems can be
further divided based on how these individuals or small groups came to power:

- Monarchy - The classic kings and queens, where power is passed onto family
  members. With the development of agriculture, small hunter-gatherer
  communities started settling down in one place and populations grew. The
  family became the smallest group unit and the leaders would attempt to
  maintain power within their families. Some of the oldest recorded monarchies
  were the Pharaohs of Ancient Egypt around 3000 BCE, and even up until 200
  years ago, most countries were monarchies or some other form of autocracy.  
  The United Kingdom is what is known as a constitutional monarchy, where the
  leaders are elected and the royal family has little real power. The largest
  modern monarchy is Saudi Arabia, whose de facto ruler is the King's son,
  Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

- Plutocracy - A society that is ruled by the wealthiest individuals. Some
  would argue that some modern wealthy democracies are part plutocracies, as it
  is only the extremely wealthy who have the means and opportunities to go into
  politics as a career, and they in turn create policies that serve the wealth.  
  As an example, in the U.K as of 2019, 29% of Members of Parliament went to
  private school, compared to 7% of the general population.

- Aristocracy - From Greek, this literally means 'rule by the best'. Though
  today it is a vague term with both positive and negative connotations. It's
  come to be used as a general term for the wealthiest, most powerful people in
  society. In Ancient Greece it was contrasted favourably with monarchy, and
  they believed, that if it was corrupted, where there is rule by the few but
  not by the best, it would be easier to correct than a corrupt democracy which
  could descend into mob rule.

A dictatorship can be thought of as an autocracy or oligarchy, but with the
emphasis that the have **_complete control_** over how the country is run. A
dictatorship can manifest through the above systems, but it can also arise from
the following:

- Military dictatorship / Stratocracy - Rule by a military institution, such as
  Myanmar, following the coup in February 2021, where the military deposed the
  current democratically elected members of the country.

- Single party dictatorship - Rule by a single party holding a unified
  ideology, such as China ruled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), led by Xi
  Jinpig

- Personalist dictatorship - Rule by a single individual. Though North Korea is
  technically a single party state, ruled by the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK),
  it's leader Kim Jong-un holds such immense power that many would classify it
  as a peronalist dictatorship. Since leadership also passes down the Kim
  family, North Korea could also be described as an absolute monarchy or a
  'hereditary dictatorship'. Saudi Arabia mentioned above could also be
  considered a 'herditary dictatorship'.

Democracy, from Greek, means 'rule by the people', and is widely considered to
the fairest political system. The first recorded democracy was the city-state
of Athens around 500 BCE, where citizens where randomly selected to fill
government positions, and all citizens could speak and vote to make decisions
in public gatherings. Though the term citizen then was closely tied to those
who were obligated to fight in war, and therefore excluded women, slaves and
foreigners. This form of democracy where everyone participates in all
decisions is called a **_direct democracy_** and is only really possible in
small communities. The prominent political system today is the representative
democracy, where people vote to choose the people who they feel most accurately
represent their own views, to make decisions in government. These people are
often associated with a 'party', which is just a group of people who hold
similar views. Not everyone in a democracy had their voice heard straightaway.  
Initially the government of the United Kingdom was only elected by male
property owners, which was just 3% of the population in 1780. **_Suffrage_**
means the right to vote in political elections, and the degree of universal
suffrage (the right to vote without resriction due to gender, race, social
status, education or wealth) is strongly correlated with the degree of
democracy in a country. The journey to universal suffrage in every democracy
has been a fiercel contested struggle with numerous revolutions, protests and
violence. In 1893, New Zealand was the only country in the world with universal
suffrage, while now 75 countries are considered to be democracies, with most
having universal suffrage. Though a country may technically be a democracy,
that is it has elections to assign leaders, it's level of democracy, that is
it's level of 'rule by the people' can differ greatly. For example, fewer
significant parties, suppression of opposing parties, low levels of
participation and corruption of government officials all decrease the level of
democracy of country. The Economist Intelligence Groups [Democracy
Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index) is a way to objectively
measure the level of democracy.

It's important to note here that the names of parties and even of countries do
not necessarily reflect on their political stance. For example, North Korea's
offician name is the 'Democratic People's Republic of Korea', while it ranks
last in the above democracy index.

### The economic spectrum

The economic system of a country can be much more fluid than it's systems of
power, so rather than look at individual countries or individual systems, let's
look at the ideologies on either end of the scale and some examples of policies
utilising these ideologies.

Socialism is the ideology that there should be social ownership of property. As
we saw in the first section, there can be many different kinds of 'property'.  
In democracies, one way in which socialism takes places is in the form of
income redistribution to fund public services. Wealthier individuals pay a
greater proportion of their income than people who aren't as well as off, in
the form of taxes. These taxes then go on to fund public services that everyone
has access to, such as transport, healthcare and education. One reasoning
behind this is not everyone is born with the same privileges and opportunities,
and therefore redistribution is required so no-one deprived of what is
considered to be their basic rights and freedoms. Meanwhile capitalism argues
that this redistribution of income violates the most important right of all,
that of personal freedom or liberty, and that the world is primarily
meritocratic, which means that privilege and power is gained by those on the
basis of talent and effort, therefore it's fair.

An important type of property that is at the centre of the socialism vs
capitalism debate, is the 'means of production'. This includes raw materials,
factories and infrastructure, throught products can be made and services can be
provided. Proponents of capitalism argue that private ownership of the means of
productions, creates innovation and economic growth, as different groups of
people compete to create better products or provide better services utilising
the means of production. This resulting improvement in the economy then
benefits the whole population. A socialist criticism to this would be that this
system prioritises profit over social good, and that demand for a product is
not reflective of it's social value. They would say that it's unfair that
celebrities and athletes receive disproportionately high incomes, compared to
say doctors or firefighters.

Socialists might also argue that excessive private ownership creates a small
capitalist class, who owns the means of production and who can then easily
exploit the working class whose only real 'property ownership' is their own
capacity to labour. Capitalists would say that a class system is inevitable as
different people desire different things and you shouldn't infringe on an
individuals freedom to purchase, own or exchange property.

_Note: Economic systems and power structures have existed for a long time, but
human rights as the freedoms that no policy can infringe has only started to
develop and expand relatively recently in human history. For example, up until
the early 1800s, slavery was common throughout the world, i.e., the ownership
of people themselves as property, who are then employed in forced labour and
forbidden to quit._

Socialist and capitalist policies can exist anywhere on the power spectrum,
making it possible to create a four axis graph, which gives a general idea as
to a policy's, person's, party's or country's political stance

`political-compass-simple`

_Note: In a democracy, that there can be parties holding very different views,
which is known as pluralism and is an important part of democracy. The above
position in the graph of a democracy is primarily in comparison to the other
political systems on the graph._

## Ideologies

Political Ideologies can be

- general views on how society should be organised,
- patterns of behaviour that people or groups exhibit, or methods that are used
  to achieve the above organisation
- specific stances on issues

The systems we have just discussed can also be thought of as ideologies. Let's
look at some more common ones:

Communism - A highly authoritarian form of socialism. This means that for
example, rather than just redistribution of income, all property is either
owned communaly or owned by the state, most wages are set by the state and
strictly controlled. It is also often accompanied by reduced freedom of
expression and suppression of views contradictory to the ruling group.

Feminism - Focusing on creating equality between genders; for example in
suffrage, pay and education. Also improving reproductive rights and increasing
legal protection from domestic violence and sexual harassment.

Nationalism - Promoting the interests and independence of the home nation

Fascism - Dictatorships with an an extreme form of nationalism, characterized
by strict social heirarchies and use of force to suppress opposition. It's used
interchangeably with Nazism.

Imperialism - The policy of extending a country's power beyond it's own border,
which can be done through colonization, using military force or creating debt

Environmentalism - Focus on more policies being required to preserve, restore
and improve the environment.

Conservatism - While the actual principles may vary depending on the country,
the general belief is that tradition values and culture must be respected and
social change must be slow and incremental

# Government

In this section we'll be looking at how the leadership (the government) is
setup and organised in a fair democracy. The government is not a single unit,
but rather consists of three parts, with no person technically being allowed to
belong to more than one part, though there is often minor overlap.

- Legislative- the part that makes laws
- Executive - the part that carries out (executes) the laws
- Judiciary - the courts that decide if the law has been broken

This concept is called **_separation of powers_**. This exists to ensure that
for example, people cannot create laws (as part of the legislative) that
they can execute (as part of the executive) to help just themselves or give
themselves more power, or ignore laws they've broken (as part of the
judiciary). The three parts keep each other in check, which is known as having
**_checks and balances_**.

Another concept is **_devolution_**, which is transfer of power from the
central government to local government. When this transfer of power is
permanent, protected and extensive, it is known as **_federalism_** and
countries operating like this are know as federal states, such as the United
States of America and Australia, where policies between states can be
significantly different. The United Kingdom on the other hand is **_unitary
state_** meaning the majority of power rests with the central government.

## Legislative

The legislative branch of the government can be unicameral, containing one
house, or bicameral, containing two houses. Most governments have a
bicameral system to avoid having power concentrated in one group. The United
Kingdom legislative branch is called the Parliament of the United Kingdom and
consists of the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The United States
legislative branch is called the Congress and consists of the House of
Representatives and the Senate. The Indian legislative branch is also called
the Parliament, and consists of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.

The bicameral systems typically have a 'lower house' (House of Commons, House
of Representatives, Lok Sabha) which consists of members directly elected by
the general population, and an 'upper house'(House of Lords, Senate, Rajya
Sabha) consisting of members who are separately appointed in some manner.

Members who are elected to the lower house are often part of groups called
'parties', these are groups of people who hold similar political ideologies.  
The leaders of the party are the face of the election campaigns. Though their
personalities can have a significant influence on the outcome of the election,
citizens are voting for the party they feel best matches their own ideologies
and the policies they most agree with, which that party say the intend to
create. Party members don't stand for election nationally, but rather for a
specific region, and if their party gets the most votes in that region, they
are said to then go on to represent that region in parliament. The head of the
government is the leader of the party that then has the most representatives in
government. This party is said to have the majority, while party getting the
second highest number of votes is said to have the minority.

You may come across the terms 'head of state' and 'head of government'. These
terms exists because historically the head of the state was the king and as
countries evolved to incorporate democracy and have elected governments, there
was also the head of the government. In countries that evolved this way, the
head of state role is now largely ceremonial. For example, in the United
Kingdom the head of government is the Prime Minister, while the head of state
is Queen Elizabeth II. In countries that didn't evolve this way the leader of
the executive often takes the head of state and head of government titles, but
may just take the head of state title while the head of government is said to
be the leader of the legislature.

## Executive

You would have likely heard the terms Prime Minister and President, and that
some countries have one and not the other. This happens because it's based on
one of two primary ways that the executive branch is set up, the parliamentary
system and presidential system. Depending on how things are setup, it changes
who is effectively the head of government and has the most power in government.

In a parliamentary system, the executive branch often derives from the
legislative, with the head of the executive branch also being the head of the
legislative branch. This though infringing on the concept of separation of
powers, still works because checks and balances are maintained through other
processes, like having a separate head of state or other laws that are in
place to limit power. The executive also consists of the heads of the different
government departments.

United Kingdom follows a parliamentary system; the head is the Prime Minister,
who is the leader of the party that won a majority of votes in the general
election. The executive is called the Cabinet and the rest of the members are
selected by the Prime Minister, and they are called Cabinet Ministers.

In a presidential system, there is stricter separation between the executive
and the legislature. The President is the head of the executive, while the
Prime Minister (if one exists) is the head of the legislature.

The United States follows a presidential system; the head is the President, who
is the leader of the party who received the majority of votes in the general
election. The executive is also called the Cabinet and chosen by the President.  
The leaders of the legislature (Congress) meanwhile are elected by their
respective houses (House of Representatives and Senate). Each house, from their
respective parties elect a Majority Leader, Majority Whip, Minority Leader and
Minority Whip. The main leader of the Congress, elected by members from all
parties is the Speaker of the House, who is elected by the House of
Representatives.

India is unique in that although it follows a parliamentary system, with the
head of government (of executive and legislature), the Prime Minister, being
the person with the most power, there is also a President. This is largely a
ceremonial role, and it was created to replace the head of state role held by
King George VI when India gained independence from the British Empire. The
executive is called the Union Council of Ministers and is chosen by the Prime
Minister

# Voting

Voting is the way through which everyone in a democracy can participate in the
political process. It's important to vote even if you feel the party you would
like to win, stands little change of winning in your region. This is because it
shows support for the policies that party is advocating for, and makes it more
likely that the winning party will pay attention to them. Even if you don't
want to vote, because for example you highly disagree with all parties or feel
disillusioned with the political process and you feel you aren't truly being
heard, you can make this known by 'spoiling the ballot'. You do this by
submitting a ballot that is ineligible, like the example below. These are
recorded and counted, they just won't be a vote towards any party.

Before voting it's important to first understand what your views and what
changes you would like to be made in society. Hopefully this resource you have
just gone through has contributed to that. Some more resources include:

Secondly you find the party that most fits your views, which is done by reading
the parties manifesto
