# What Is Politics?

The idea of politics often brings to mind prominent political figures such as
the prime minister and leaders of parties, buildings such as the houses of
parliament, and following laws lest you be jailed.

While all these things are part of politics in the United Kingdom, it makes it
seem as though politics is quite distant from our daily lives and not something
to pay too much attention to.

However the core of politics is very simple, and applies to a much broader
ranger of things

Politics is about making decisions

Politics is about making decisions that are fair and just.

Politics is about people making group decisions as to how resources are shared
and what people should do, based on what they think is fair and just.

Lets break this statement down

1.  Groups - The 'group' in politics often means country, also referred to as a
    state, but it can also mean a city, a company, a sports club, a school and
    many more things. There always exists the difficult question of who belongs
    to a group, as some groups may be more preferable to be in that others. In a
    school this is simply anyone who studies or works at the school at the
    moment in time, while in a country it is more complex. You can be a member,
    or a citizen of a country, by being born there, but most countries also have
    processes where you can become a citizen of their country, and these
    processes are often quite complex.

2.  Making Decisions - How decisions are made and who gets to make them is the
    foundation of politics.

3.  Sharing Resources - The primary resource here is often money. Countries have
    a national budget, money they have collected through taxes that they decide how
    to spend on public services. A sports club may have to decide between hiring
    better coaches or buying new equipment, using the fees they charge their
    members for using their facilities. Resources, particularly in the case of
    countries can be many other things, like land and the natural resources they
    contain, access to services like public transport and healthcare and even the
    people themselves.

4.  What people should do - These are the 'laws' or 'rules' and can be broadly
    broken down into "rights", what people should be allowed to do if they need
    to or want to and "responsibilities", what people should do to be a good
    member of the group. For example, in a school, students have the right to
    ask for and recieve help from their teachers, while they have the
    responsibility to complete their homework and assignments on time.

5.  What is fair and just - This aspect of politics is called ethics or
    morality, and is at the core of the decision making process. When asking what
    is fair and just, we are essentially asking what actions are good and what
    actions are evil? This is particularly important when dealing with wrong doers

    Even things that on the surface may seem to be straightforward, like the
    morality of killing, can be quite complex depending on the context

    People generally agree that killing someone is wrong, and if someone does
    they must be punished and removed from society to protect others.

    But what if it was done in self defense? Then that's okay

    But what if they used excessive force, that is they used a gun when all
    that happened was an unarmed person pushed them

    What if someone in another situation someone walks past someone else on the
    street who needed medical help and did nothing, are they in the wrong then?

# Political Systems

You may have heard of political terms like democracy, communism and
dictatorships. These are terms used to describe systems on how decisions are
made and who gets to make them

Let's model some of these systems in your school so you can better understand
them.
